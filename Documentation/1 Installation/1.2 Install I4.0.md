# Install I4.0
> [!NOTE]
> If you're having troubles using the `python` command, try `python3`.

# Clone I4.0
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TAO71-AI/I4.0.git
cd I4.0/LibI4/Python_AI/
```

# Create VENV
A Python VENV is not required for I4.0, but it's recommended to be used.
Otherwise, you might experience bugs, errors or crashes.
```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```

# Install I4.0's requirements
```bash
python InstallRequirements.py
```

This should automatically detect your GPU and install the requirements.
Make sure you have CUDA, ROCm, or SYCL installed in your system before running this if you want to use your GPU.

If you have a GPU that is not compatible with CUDA, ROCm, nor SYCL, but it's compatible with Vulkan, the script will install the requirements for Vulkan compatibility if you have the Vulkan drivers installed.

## Script arguments
| Argument | What it does |
|---|---|
| --gpu=*GPU VENDOR* | Sets your GPU vendor manually. Use this if the script doesn't detect your GPU automatically. |

| --torch-cuda-whl=*INDEX URL* | Sets a custom index URL for the CUDA version of PyTorch. |
| --torch-rocm-whl=*INDEX URL* | Sets a custom index URL for the ROCm version of PyTorch. |
| --torch-sycl-whl=*INDEX URL* | Sets a custom index URL for the SYCL version of PyTorch. |
| --torch-cpu-whl=*INDEX URL* | Sets a custom index URL for the CPU version of PyTorch. |
| --torch-cuda-only | Forces the script to use the CUDA version of PyTorch, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --torch-rocm-only | Forces the script to use the ROCm version of PyTorch, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --torch-intel-only **or** --torch-sycl-only | Forces the script to use the SYCL version of PyTorch, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --torch-cpu-only | Forces the script to use the CPU version of PyTorch, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --torch-pkg=*PACKAGES* | Package/s to install of PyTorch. Make sure it contains at least `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio`. |
| --lcpp-cuda-only | Forces the script to use the CUDA version of LCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --lcpp-rocm-only | Forces the script to use the ROCm version of LCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --lcpp-intel-only **or** --lcpp-sycl-only | Forces the script to use the SYCL version of LCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --lcpp-vulkan-only | Forces the script to use the Vulkan version of LCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --lcpp-cpu-only | Forces the script to use the CPU version of LCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --sdcpp-cuda-only | Forces the script to use the CUDA version of SDCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --sdcpp-rocm-only | Forces the script to use the ROCm version of SDCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --sdcpp-intel-only **or** --sdcpp-sycl-only | Forces the script to use the SYCL version of SDCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --sdcpp-vulkan-only | Forces the script to use the Vulkan version of SDCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --sdcpp-cpu-only | Forces the script to use the CPU version of SDCPP, even if your GPU is not compatible. |
| --lcpp-git | Downloads the [Github version](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) of LCPP, instead of the PIP version. Usually, the Github version is newer. |
| --lcpp-pkg=*PACKAGES* | Package/s to install of LCPP. |
| --sdcpp-git | Downloads the [Github version](https://github.com/william-murray1204/stable-diffusion-cpp-python) of SDCPP, instead of the PIP version. Usually, the Github version is newer. |
| --sdcpp-pkg=*PACKAGES* | Package/s to install of SDCPP. |
| --lcpp-f16 | Compiles LCPP with F16 support. NOT ALL DEVICES ARE COMPATIBLE. |
| --sdcpp-f16 | Compiles SDCPP with F16 support. NOT ALL DEVICES ARE COMPATIBLE. |
| --rvc-git | Downloads the [Github version](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion) of RVC, instead of the PIP version. Usually, the Github version is newer. |
| --rvc-pkg=*PACKAGES* | Package/s to install of RVC. |
| --fairseq-pkg=*PACKAGES* | Package/s to install of fairseq. |
| --verbose **or** -v | Uses the `--verbose` argument when installing a package with PIP. Prints more details about the installation. |
| --verbose-full **or** --fverbose **or** -vv | Prints every command that executes. |
| --skip-torch | Skips the installation of PyTorch. |
| --skip-lcpp | Skips the installation of LCPP. |

| --skip-fairseq | Skips the installation of fairseq. |
| --skip-other **or** --skip-other-requirements | Skips the installation of other requirements. |
| --show-command-output | Shows the output of all the commands. `--verbose` will have no effect if this is not enabled. |
| --pip-cmd=*COMMAND* | Sets a custom command for PIP. If not set, will automatically get the PIP command. Example: `pip`. |
