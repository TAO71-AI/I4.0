# Definition
A 'general service' is a service that has the same configuration parameters as other services.

# General services
The general services are:
- `qa`: Question Answering
- `uvr`
- `od`: Object Detection
- `de`: Depth Estimation
- `text2audio`
- `img2text`
- `ld`: Language Detection
- `sc`: Sequence Classification

# Configuration example
```json
{
    "service": "qa",
    "model": "deepset/roberta-base-squad2",
    "device": "cpu",
    "price": 0
}
```

## service
Set the service that you want to use.

### Parameter type
string (text)

---

## model
Model to use. Must be from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co)

### Parameter type
string (text)

---

## device
Device where the model will be loaded.
The available services are:
- `cuda`: To load the model into your NVIDIA or AMD GPU.
    - For NVIDIA:
        - Make sure you have installed your GPU drivers as well as CUDA.
    - For AMD:
        - Make sure you have installed your GPU drivers as well as ROCm.
- `xpu`: To load the model into your Intel GPU.
    - Make sure you have installed your GPU drivers as well as SYCL.
- `cpu`: To load the model into your CPU and using your RAM.
    - Doesn't require extra dependencies nor drivers.
    - Slower than using a GPU, specially using LLMs.

### Parameter type
string (text)

---

## price
The price (in tokens) that will cost to use the service for each prompt.

### Parameter type
float (floating number)

---

# Extra parameters
These are some extra and optional parameters that you can set in the configuration.
```json
{
    ···
    "description": "",
    "model_info": "",
    "dtype": "fp16",
    "allow_offloading": true
}
```

## description
Works in ALL the services, even if the service is not a general service.

Is a description/message that the users can see about the model.

### Parameter type
string (text)

---

## model_info
Works in ALL the services, even if the service is not a general service.

Is extra information for the model that will be given to it using the system prompts.

### Parameter type
string (text)

---

## dtype
Works in ALL the general services, and maybe in some other services.

Is the dtype of the model; the precision.

More precision means better results, but will require more memory and compute power.

Please check if the model supports the dtype you want before changing it.

### Available options
#### Float
- fp64
- fp32 (recommended for small models)
- fp16
- bf16 (recommended for LLMs)
- fp8_e4m3fn
- fp8_e4m3fnuz
- fp8_e5m2
- fp8_e5m2fnuz

#### Integer
- i64
- i32
- i16
- i8
- u64
- u32
- u16
- u8

### Parameter type
string (text)

---

## allow_offloading
Works in ALL the services, even if the service is not a general service.

Deletes the model from the RAM or VRAM if haven't been used in a while.

This can save a lot of memory, but takes longer to answer the prompt because it needs to load it back.

### Parameter type
boolean (true or false)
