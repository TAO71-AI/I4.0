# Start I4.0
If you run the `ai_server.py` script for the first time it will create the `config.json` file.

From here you can configure I4.0.

When you're ready start the script again, then all the models will load into the RAM (if you're using the CPU) or VRAM (if you're using a GPU).

Then, a WebSocket server will be started at the port you've configured.

# Stop the I4.0 server
To stop the I4.0 server you just need to press Ctrl+C.

# Start I4.0 database server
Run the `db_server.py` script. Make sure you have everything configured.

If you don't have any server where you can save I4.0's data such as *API keys*, *conversations*, *memories*, etc. you must create one.

> [!NOTE]
> The server will only connect to databases IN THE SAME MACHINE!
> Also, this script MUST ONLY RUN in the machine where the database is hosted.

# Stop I4.0 database server
Just press Ctrl+C.
