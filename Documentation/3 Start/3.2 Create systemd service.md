# I4.0
## Create the file
Create a new file in the **/etc/systemd/system/** directory. You can call it what you want, but for this example we will say it's called `I4.0.service`.

Inside this file, write:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=I4.0 Server
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=(I4.0 PYTHON_AI DIRECTORY)/
ExecStart=(ENV PATH)/bin/python ai_server.py
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Replacing **(I4.0 PYTHON_AI DIRECTORY)** with the path where you have the I4.0 Python AI directory.

Also, replace **(ENV PATH)** with the path where you have the VENV.

## Enable the service on system startup
```sh
systemctl enable I4.0.service
```

## Start the service
```sh
systemctl start I4.0.service
```

## Disable the service on system startup
```sh
systemctl disable I4.0.service
```

## Stop the service
```sh
systemctl stop I4.0.service
```

# I4.0 database server
## Create the file
Create a new file in the **/etc/systemd/system/** directory. You can call it what you want, but for this example we will say it's called `I4.0_db.service`.

Inside this file, write:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=I4.0 Database Server
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=(I4.0 PYTHON_AI DIRECTORY)/
ExecStart=(ENV PATH)/bin/python db_server.py
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Replacing **(I4.0 PYTHON_AI DIRECTORY)** with the path where you have the I4.0 Python AI directory.

Also, replace **(ENV PATH)** with the path where you have the VENV.

## Enable the service on system startup
```sh
systemctl enable I4.0_db.service
```

## Start the service
```sh
systemctl start I4.0_db.service
```

## Disable the service on system startup
```sh
systemctl disable I4.0_db.service
```

## Stop the service
```sh
systemctl stop I4.0_db.service
```
