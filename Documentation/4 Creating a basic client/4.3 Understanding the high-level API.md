# About the high-level API
The high-level API is a basic, yet complete and easy-to-use connection to the server.

Everything from the high-level API can also be done using the low-level API, but it's much harder.

# How to import the high-level API
There are many ways to import the high-level API:
```python
from I4_0_Client.Utils import ServerUtilities
```
You can also use:
```python
from I4_0_Client.Utils.ServerUtilities import *
```

# Classes
## SimulatedVisionV1
### Description
Simulated Vision V1: Allow non-multimodal chatbots to see and understand images and detect objects with their position in the image.

If the chatbot is multimodal, but doesn't support images (for example: audio&text), this class can also be used.

> [!WARNING]
> PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
> IF YOU CALL THE `ExecuteService` FUNCTION, IT WILL EXECUTE IT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN NEEDED.

## SimulatedVisionV2
Simulated Vision V2: Allow non-multimodal chatbots to see and understand videos.

If the chatbot is multimodal, but doesn't support videos (for example: image&text), this class can also be used.

> [!WARNING]
> PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
> IF YOU CALL THE `ExecuteService` FUNCTION, IT WILL EXECUTE IT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN NEEDED.

## SimulatedAuditionV1
Simulated Audition V1: Allow non-multimodal chatbots to listen and understand audios.

If the chatbot is multimodal, but doesn't support audios (for example: image&text), this class can also be used.

    Index: int | None = None,
    FilesPath: bool = True
) -> AsyncIterator[dict[str, any]]
```

### Description
Executes a service in the server.

This function automatically detects if it needs to use the `SimulatedVisionV1`, `SimulatedVisionV2`, or the `SimulatedAuditionV1`.

This function also formats the prompt to be able to be used by the service you want to execute.

It's a very complete function that does almost everything automatically.

### Parameters
#### Prompt
The prompt to send.

#### Files
The files to send.

Must be in this format:
```json

    }
]
```

File type can be `image`, `audio`, `video` or any other file type supported by the server.

File data can be either a **base64 string that contains the bytes of the file** or the **path to the file in your system**.

#### ServerService
Service to execute.

This parameter is of type `I4_0_Client.Service.Service`.

#### Index
Index of the model to use.

If set to `None` it will use the one set in the configuration.

#### FilesPath
