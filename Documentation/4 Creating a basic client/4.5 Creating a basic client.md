# It's easy!
Creating a basic client is very easy using the high-level API!

## Example of code to ask the chatbot a prompt (without files)
```python
from I4_0_Client.Service import Service
from I4_0_Client.Utils import ServerUtilities
import asyncio

async def main() -> None:
    # Create a response and send to the server
    response = ServerUtilities.ExecuteService(
        "Hi! How are you?",         # Prompt
        [],                         # Files
        Service.Chatbot,            # Service
        -1,                         # Model index. -1 means automatic
        False,                      # Force no connect. Use this if you DON'T want the script to connect automatically to a server
        False                       # Files path. If True means the data parameter in the files is a path to a file in a system. Else it expects a base64 string
    )

    # For each token
    async for token in response:
        # `token` is expected to be {"response": "[CHATBOT RESPONSE HERE]", "files": [], "ended": False, "errors": [], ... }
        print(token["response"], end = "", flush = True)    # Print the response from the chatbot

    # Disconnect from the server when done, to avoid errors
    await ServerUtilities.ServerCon.Disconnect()

ServerUtilities.Conf.Chatbot_Conversation = "basic-client"  # (Optional) Change the conversation name from the configuration
ServerUtilities.__update_config__()

loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()     # Create a new event loop

loop.run_until_complete(main())     # Call the function
loop.close()                        # Close the event loop when done
```
