# TAO71 I4.0
## What is this?
TAO71 I4.0 is an AI created by TAO71 in Python. It uses LLaMA-CPP-Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Hugging Face Diffusers, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> (SERVERS) In order to use I4.0 as expected, you must create a Python VENV.
> (SERVERS) It's recommended to use Python 3.11.9 (or Python 3.11), but Python 3.12 should also be compatible.

## Hardware requirements
### Servers
CPU: Any x86_64 CPU with AVX or AVX2 and 2+ cores.

GPU (optional): Any GPU with NVIDIA CUDA, ROCm or SYCL for Hugging Face Transformers, Hugging Face Diffusers or any GPU compatible with Vulkan for GPT4All or LLaMA-CPP-Python.

RAM: At least 4 GB for basic usage (NOTE: We are not including the RAM required for the OS here).

OS: Any GNU/Linux distribution that supports Python 3.11.

Python: 3.8 should be compatible, but 3.11 is more tested.

### Clients
CPU: Any CPU. Due to encryption we recommend a 2+ cores CPU or set the encryption to a fastest one.

RAM: ~512 MB or ~384 MB should be enough (NOTE: We are not including the RAM required for the OS here).

OS: Any OS that supports Python 3.8 or higher.

Python: At least 3.8 (only tested on Python 3.11 and Python 3.13).
